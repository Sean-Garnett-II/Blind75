Ch 6: Lambdas and Functional Interfaces

Lambda Syntax

(parameters) -> { body }
parameter -> body
with no braces you don't need to use a semicolin or type a return statement

Lambas only work with interfaces that have only one abstract method. 
These are called Functional Interaces

The functional interface has only one abstract method
SAM Rule Single Abstract Method

Predicate

public interface Predicate<T> {
	boolean test(T t);
}

Variables in Lambdas

Parameter List
Local Variables inside the Lambda Body
Variables Referenced from the Lambda Body
	Instance and local variables are always allowed
	Method parameters and local variables are allowed to be referenced if they are effectivly final
